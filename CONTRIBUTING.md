# Contributing to Herostratus

## Project goals

This is a silly project to gamify things that shouldn't be gamified.

* The achievements should be whimsical and silly, and absolutely not be used in a serious manner
* It should be fast
* Its preferred UI is the CLI
* It should be easyish to set up by a new user
* It should be easyish to add new rules
* Its target runtime environment is modern Linux x86_64
* It should provide optional integrations:
    * It should provide an integration with [GitLab achievements](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/achievements.html)
    * It could provide an integration with GitHub

## Releases

Releases are automated by the CI/CD pipeline. They are triggered by bumping the version number in
the [Cargo.toml](Cargo.toml).

The process is:
1. Submit a PR making the release
   1. Bump the version number in `Cargo.toml`
   2. Add a new entry to the `CHANGELOG.md`
   3. Add any last-minute polish to the `CHANGELOG.md`
2. Make sure the CI/CD pipeline passes
3. Merge it!

The changelog entries are automatically added to the generated releases:
<https://github.com/Notgnoshi/herostratus/releases>.

**Please keep the release notes focused on the user impact**

## Tests

This project values tests, as well as documentation

## MSRV

The Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is the latest stable toolchain.

## Logging

Logs are great. Spammy logs are less great.

* The default log level for users is INFO. INFO should not be spammy
* Prefer logs that are useful for troubleshooting, both from a developer perspective and a user one

  E.g., prefer `"failed to process repository '{repo}' because: '{e:?}'"` over `"Failed to process
  repository"`

## Git

All PRs are to be rebased on top of `main` prior to merging. Multi-commit PRs will be merged with a
merge commit.

**This project values its Git history.**

@Notgnoshi reserves the right to make subjective judgement calls, but is willing to work with PR
authors who have different opinions.

This project uses `gitlint` in the CI/CD pipeline. You can run `gitlint` yourself with the same
rules as the pipeline by setting the following two environment variables

```sh
# Run from within the Herostratus repository directory
export GITLINT_CONFIG="$PWD/.github/gitlint/gitlint.ini"
export GITLINT_EXTRA_PATH="$PWD/.github/gitlint"
gitlint --commits main..HEAD
```
You can invoke gitlint through the CLI, your editor, or as a commit hook.

**I don't desire a perfect history. Just a good one.**
