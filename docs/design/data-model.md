# Data model
**Status:** In consideration

**TODO:** What _is_ an achievement? It should probably hold:
* achievement id
* title
* description
* level (copper, silver, gold, platinum)
* number of instances
* user id (email? how to handle .mailmap?)
* the generating commits (how to do this in a way that's linkable in the representation layer?)

How to handle .mailmap files? Should that be done before or after achievement creation?
